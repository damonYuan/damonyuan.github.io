title:  "Start ShadowSocks in One Minute"
description: "For the reason you know what, it is always difficult to access github or run some command to fetch remote resource from inside China network. One of the solution is to punch a hole in the Great Wall by setting up ShadowSocks proxy to route your traffic through secured tunnel. There are many great articles to introduce the theory of ShadowSocks and the installation of it, but there is none that automate the process of it. Here is a a automation shell script to help start ShadowSocks server and client in a minute, and it is tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Feel free to modify it according to your requirement."

For the reason you know what, it is always difficult to access github or run some command to fetch remote resource from inside China network. One of the solution is to punch a hole in the Great Wall by setting up ShadowSocks proxy to route your traffic through secured tunnel. There are many great articles to introduce the theory of ShadowSocks and the installation of it, but there is none that automate the process of it. Here is a a automation shell script to help start ShadowSocks server and client in a minute, and it is tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Feel free to modify it according to your requirement.

* Theory of ShadowSocks: [你也能写个 ShadowSocks](https://github.com/gwuhaolin/blog/issues/12 "你也能写个 Shadowsocks"); [ShadowSocks 源代码分析](https://loggerhead.me/posts/shadowsocks-yuan-ma-fen-xi-xie-yi-yu-jie-gou.html#fn:router-problem)
* Set proxy for docker: [Docker网络代理设置](http://blog.csdn.net/styshoo/article/details/55657714 "Docker网络代理设置")
* Thanks to this article [为终端设置Shadowsocks代理](http://droidyue.com/blog/2016/04/04/set-shadowsocks-proxy-for-terminal/ "为终端设置Shadowsocks代理"), and the implementation of this script is based on it.
