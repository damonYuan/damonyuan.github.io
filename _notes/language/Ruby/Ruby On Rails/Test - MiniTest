===============

## testing tools:
  1. controller tests : MiniTest -> $ bundle exec rake test
  2. model tests
  3. integration tests

## MiniTest
  1. assert_select -> let us test for the presence of particular HTML tag
  2. assert_response -> let us know if a response is returned succssfully

  Note: run the test before deploying.

## Advanced testing setup for MiniTest
  1. MiniTest reporters (in test/test_helper.rb)

     require 'minitest/reporters'
     MiniTest::Reporters.use!

     Notes: before it, should include the gem in gemfile
       
       gem 'minitest-reporters', '1.0.8'

       Then run 

       $ bundle update
       $ bundle install --without production
