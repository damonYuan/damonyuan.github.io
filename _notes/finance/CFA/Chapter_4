4.1 Introduction

4.2 GDP
    1. Expenditure Approach: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
    2. Resource Cost/Income Approach: GDP by resource cost/income approach = wages + self-employment income + Rent + Interest + profits + indirect business taxes + depreciation + net income of foreigners.
    3. GDI                                                                 = wages + self-employment income + Rent + Interest + profits + indirect business taxes + depreciation + net income of foreigners.

4.3 Nominal vs. Real GDP, and the GDP Deflator
    1. Real GDP for a given year, in relation to a "base" year, is computed by multiplying the nominal GDP for a given year by the ratio of the GDP price deflator in the base year to the GDP price deflator for the given year.

4.4 Limitations of GDP and Alternative Measures
    1. Limitations: 
        * Changes in quality and the inclusion of new goods 
        * Underground economy
        * Harmful Side Effects
        * Non-Market Production 
    2. Alternatives:
        * National income is computed by subtracting indirect business taxes, the net income of foreigners, and depreciation from GDP. 
        * Personal income represents income available for personal use. It is computed by making various adjustments to national income.
        * Disposable personal income (or disposable income) is income available to people after taxes; i.e., it is personal income less individual taxes.

4.5 Components of Marginal Product and Marginal Revenue
   
4.6 The Demand and Supply of Financial and Physical Capital
    1. present value = future value / (1 + r) Where: "r" represents the relevant interest rate
    
4.7 Economic Rent and Opportunity Cost

4.8 Monitoring Cycles, Jobs, and Price Level

4.9 Key Labor Market Indicators
    1. The Labor Force Participation Rate
    2. The Unemployment Rate
    3. The Employment/Population Ratio
    4. GDP, Real Wages and Aggregate Hours Worked
        Changes in real wage rates can be calculate by dividing nominal wages by the GDP deflator. 

4.10 Types of Unemployment
    1. Types:
        1. Structural Unemployment
        2. Frictional Unemployment 
        3. Cyclical Unemployment
    2. Full employment / natural rate of unemployment is defined as the level of employment that occurs when unemployment is normal, taking into account structural and frictional factors.

4.11 The Consumer Price Index & Inflation
    1. Inflation is defined as an increase in the overall price level. 
    2. CPI Sources of Bias
       * Quality adjustments 
       * New goods
       * Substitution

4.12 Aggregate Supply & Aggregate Demand

4.13 Short and Long-run Macroeconomic Equilibrium
    1. unanticipate increase in SAD ?
    2. unanticipate decrease in SAD ?
    3. unanticipate increase in SAS ? 
    4. unanticipate decrease in SAS ?
    5. Self-correcting Mechanisms:
        * Change in resource price
        * Change in Real Interest rate
        * Relative stability of consumption: The permanent income hypotheses states that household consumption is mainly a function of expected long-range (permanent) income.
