# Certification Exam Guide

> https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect/

## Section 1: Designing and planning a cloud solution architecture

### 1.1 Designing a solution infrastructure that meets business requirements. Considerations include:

* business use cases and product strategy
* cost optimization
* supporting the application design
* integration
* movement of data
* tradeoffs

  - Google Compute Engine vs. Google App Engine
  - Standard VMs. vs Preemptible VMs
  - Local SSD vs. SSD Persistent Disks
  - Global vs. Regional vs. Zonal resources
  - Google App Engine vs. Google Kubernetes Engine
  - HTTP Load Balancer vs. Network Load Balancer
  - Primitive IAM Roles vs. predefined IAM Roles
  - App Engine Standard vs. App Engine Flex
  - Cloud Storage vs. BigQuery for Stackdriver Sink
  
* build, buy or modify
* success measurements (e.g., Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Return on Investment (ROI), metrics)
* Compliance and observability

### 1.2 Designing a solution infrastructure that meets technical requirements. Considerations include:

* high availability and failover design
* elasticity of cloud resources
* scalability to meet growth requirements

### 1.3 Designing network, storage, and compute resources. Considerations include:

* integration with on premises/multi-cloud environments
* Cloud native networking (VPC, peering, firewalls, container networking)
* identification of data processing pipeline
* matching data characteristics to storage systems
* data flow diagrams
* storage system structure (e.g., Object, File, RDBMS, NoSQL, NewSQL)
* mapping compute needs to platform products

### 1.4 Creating a migration plan (i.e., documents and architectural diagrams). Considerations include:

* integrating solution with existing systems
* migrating systems and data to support the solution
* licensing mapping
* network and management planning
* testing and proof-of-concept

### 1.5 Envisioning future solution improvements. Considerations include:

* cloud and technology improvements
* business needs evolution
* evangelism and advocacy

## Section 2: Managing and provisioning solution Infrastructure

### 2.1 Configuring network topologies. Considerations include:

* extending to on-premise (hybrid networking)
* extending to a multi-cloud environment which may include GCP to GCP communication 
* security
* data protection

### 2.2 Configuring individual storage systems. Considerations include:

* data storage allocation
* data processing/compute provisioning
* security and access management
* network configuration for data transfer and latency
* data retention and data lifecycle management
* data growth management

### 2.3 Configuring compute systems. Considerations include:

* compute system provisioning
* compute volatility configuration (preemptible vs. standard)
* network configuration for compute nodes
* infrastructure provisioning technology configuration (e.g. Chef/Puppet/Ansible/Terraform)
* container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes)

## Section 3: Designing for security and compliance

### 3.1 Designing for security. Considerations include:

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)

  - [policy hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#policy_hierarchy)
  
* Resource hierarchy (organizations, folders, projects)
* data security (key management, encryption)
* penetration testing
* Separation of Duties (SoD)
* security controls
* Managing customer-supplied encryption keys with Cloud KMS

### 3.2 Designing for legal compliance. Considerations include:

* legislation (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), etc.)
* audits (including logs)
* certification (e.g., Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework)

## Section 4: Analyzing and optimizing technical and business processes

### 4.1 Analyzing and defining technical processes. Considerations include:

* Software Development Lifecycle Plan (SDLC)
* continuous integration / continuous deployment
* troubleshooting / post mortem analysis culture
* testing and validation
* IT enterprise process (e.g. ITIL)
* business continuity and disaster recovery

### 4.2 Analyzing and defining business processes. Considerations include:

* stakeholder management (e.g. Influencing and facilitation)
* change management
* team assessment / skills readiness
* decision making process
* customer success management
* cost optimization / resource optimization (Capex / Opex)

### 4.3 Developing procedures to test resilience of solution in production (e.g., DiRT and Simian Army)

## Section 5: Managing implementation

### 5.1 Advising development/operation team(s) to ensure successful deployment of the solution. Considerations include:

* application development
* API best practices
  
  - > https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/lifecycle-management
  
* testing frameworks (load/unit/integration)
* data and system migration tooling

### 5.2 Interacting with Google Cloud using GCP SDK (gcloud, gsutil and bq). Considerations include:

* local installation
* Google Cloud Shell

## Section 6: Ensuring solution and operations reliability

### 6.1 Monitoring/Logging/Alerting solution

### 6.2 Deployment and release management

### 6.3 Supporting operational troubleshooting

### 6.4 Evaluating quality control measures
