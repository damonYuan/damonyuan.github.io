Foundations of Risk Management
========

## Risk Management: A Helicopter View

#### LO 1.1: Explain the concept of risk and compare risk management to risk taking.

* Risk: arise from uncertainty regarding an entity's
	1. future losses
	2. future gains

> Risk is not necessarily related to the size of potential loss...
> The more important concern is the variability of the loss, especially a loss that could rise to unexpectedly high levels or a loss that suddenly occurs that was not anticipated.

* Risk management: sequence of activities aimed at
	1. reduce or eliminate the expected loss
	2. manage the unexpected variability of some costs

> risk management is actually broader in the sense that it considers how an entity can consciously determine how much risk it is willing to take to earn future uncertain returns, which involves risk taking.

* Risk taking: refers specifically to the active assumption of incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains.

#### LO 1.2: Describe the risk management process and identify problems and challenges which can arise in the risk management process.

* Risk management process: 
	1. Identify the risk
	2. Quantify and estimate the **risk exposures** **or** determine appropriate methods to transfer the risks.
	3. Determine the collective effects of the risk exposures **or** perform a cost-benefit analysis on risk transfer methods.
	4. Develop a risk mitigation strategy (i.e., avoid, transfer, mitigate, or assume risk).
	5. Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed.

> **risk exposures**: Risk exposure is a quantified loss potential of business. Risk exposure is usually calculated by multiplying the probability of an incident occurring by its potential losses.
> **risk transfer methods**: TODO
> **risk mitigation strategy**: TODO

* Challenges in ensuring risk management willl be beneficail to the economy: 
	1. risk must be sufficiendy dispersed among willing and able participants in the economy
	2. it has failed to consistently assist in preventing market disruptions or preventing financial accounting fraud (due to corporate governance failures).
	3. the use of derivatives as complex trading strategies assisted in overstating the financial position (i.e., net assets on balance sheet) o f many entities and understating the level of risk assumed by many entities.
	4. risk management may not be effective on an overall economic basis because it only involves risk transferring by one party and risk assumption by another party.

> A **derivative** is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset, index or security. Common underlying instruments include: bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes and stocks.

#### LO 1.3: Evaluate and apply tools and procedures used to measure and manage risk, including quantitative measures, qualitative assessment, and enterprise risk management.


> **Qualitative Research** is primarily exploratory research. It is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. It provides insights into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses for potential quantitative research.

* Quantitative Measures
	1. **Value at Risk** states a certain loss amount and its probability of occurring. useful when: 
		1. liquid positons
		2. normal market circumstance
		3. over a short period of time

		* types: delta-normal VaR, historical VaR, and Monte Carlo simulation VaR (In book 4)

	2. **Economic capital** refers to holding sufficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss.

* Qualitative Assessment
	1. **Scenario analysis** takes into account potential risk factors with uncertainties that are often non-quantifiable. 
	2. **Stress testing** is a form of scenario analysis that examines a financial outcome based on a given “stress” on the entity. 

* Enterprise Rish Management:
    ERM takes an integrative approach to risk management within an entire entity, dispensing of the traditional approach of independently managing risk within each department or division of an entity. ERM considers entity-wide risks and tries to integrate risk considerations into key business decisions.

#### LO 1.4: Distinguish between expected loss and unexpected loss, and provide examples o f each.

* Expected (eg. bad debt) and Unexpected (eg. economic recession, real property price fall) loss
	* recovery rate risk
	* default rate risk
	* correlation rate risks

### LO 1.5: Interpret the relationship between risk and reward.
    1. publicly traded securities
    2. non-publicly traded securities

### LO 1.6: Describe and differentiate between the key classes of risks, explain how each type of risk can arise, and assess the potential impact of each type of risk on an organization.
	1. Market Risk: Market risk considers how changes in market prices and rates will result in investment losses.
		* interest rate risk
		* equity price risk
		* foreign exchange risk
		* commodity price risk
