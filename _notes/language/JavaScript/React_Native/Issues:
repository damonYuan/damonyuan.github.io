Issues:

Android:

1. cannot release the focus on TextInput
   clear the text on focus

2. no alertDialog
   make module to make use of native component.

3. return button turn to next magically and will lead to crash.
   Fixed by 0.12.0

4. TextInput scrollView contentOffset not work.
   ???

5. HUD
   workaround using modal view

6. no modal view

7. cannot resign text field first responder

8. textField cannot go to next

9. text cannot have bottom line

10. localization

11. disable button when loading



iOS:
5. One downside to that approach is that you'd have to manually set the tintColor of the image when the button is disabled; there isn't a good way for the button component to set the tintColor of its children at this time (when React 0.14 comes out this will become possible).
