- languages do prepared-beforehand compiling from source code to machine code (and then link with other existing compiled object files), a.k.a., compiled languages: C, C++ (might have Assembly)
- languages compile to bytecode and then passing the bytecode to virtual machine; in the vm the bytecode will be interpreted to machine code through JIT interpreter, a.k.a., VM programming languages: Java, Python, PHP ...
- languages work by walking an AST representation derived from the source code, a.k.a., interpreted programming languages: Perl, Ruby 1.8 ...
- languages do directly JIT compiling from source code to machine code with no bytecode intermediary: JavaScript V8, Dart ...
