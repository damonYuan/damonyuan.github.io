### Problem statement

conversation about using MVVM or VIP -> why we need these patterns?

### The possible reasons of using MVVM or some other patterns

1. Decoupling, separating the UI logic from business logic
2. Extensible, reducing the complexity of the program
3. Unit Test (not Integration Test)

### Interface vs Event Bus

1. How to implement Interface
2. How to implement Event Bus
3. Why Event Bus is preferred

### How to verify we are implement MVVM in the right way

If classes in different layers can be decoupled in compile time regarding the dependencies, it means that the MVVM is implemented in the right way.

### Conclusion

That's why I think VIP is over-engineering compared with MVVM.
