### Miscellaneous

* #### [Sell-Off]
	1. Minor sell-offs are considered pullbacks. Pullbacks tend to hold support at the 50-period moving average. 

* #### [Simple Moving Average - SMA] and [Exponential Moving Average - EMA]
	* The EMA might increase the number of false signals because it is more sensitive.
	* [Why 50 SMA is so common for traders and analysts?]

		* In a sustained uptrend, price generally remains above the 50-period moving average and the 50-period moving average remains above the 100-period moving average. If price moves significantly below the 50-period moving average, and especially if it closes below that level, it is commonly interpreted by analysts as signaling a possible trend change to the downside. The 50-period moving average crossing below and remaining below the 100-period moving average gives the same signal.
        
        * Long-term trend traders commonly use the 50-day SMA, whereas intraday stock or forex traders often employ a 50-period exponential moving average, or EMA on a one-hour chart.

		1. [Cash and cash equivalents]: Cash equivalents are investments that can readily be converted into cash. The investment must be short-term, usually with a maximum investment duration of three months or less.  eg.
			* [Treasury Bills]: short-term less than three months
			* [Short-term Certificate of Deposit]
			* hard currency
			* demand deposit accounts: checking accounts and saving accounts
		2. [Marketable Securities]: The liquidity of marketable securities comes from the fact that the maturites tend to be less than one year.  eg.
			* [Commercial Paper]
			* [banker's acceptance]

	> Assets are recorded on companies' balance sheets based on the concept of historical cost, which represents the original cost of the asset, adjusted for any improvements or aging. Historical cost is also called the book value.



* [Accounts Receivable - AR]


* [Receivables]
	
	> From an accounting perspective, receivables represent a placeholder for cash. When companies want to increase revenue growth, they can extend credit terms or loosen eligibility requirements on credit. The company likely increases sales, but some of those sales may never turn into cash. This is one reason analysts like to use cash flow ratios as opposed to earnings ratios. However, cash flows can also be exploited. If a company wants to increase cash flow, it can reduce credit terms or take longer to pay its own receivables, also referred to as payables. When companies manipulate these line items to increase cash, it is referred to as extending the cash flow cycle.

* [Line Of Credit - LOC]
	
	> A line of credit is a type of revolving account. This means that the borrower can spend the money, repay it and spend it again, in a virtually never-ending, revolving cycle. 

	* home equity lines of credit (HELOC): notable exception that it is secured in the borrower's home

	* Demand Line of Credit: A demand LOC is a rare type of credit line in which the lender can call the loan due at any time. 
    

* [Redemption]:
	1. the return of an investor's principal in a fixed income security, such as a preferred stock or bond
	2. the sale of units in a mutual fund. 

* EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
  EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

	* four sections: 
		1. [Balance sheet]
			* Three parts: (A = L + E)

    			2. Liabilities
    			3. Equity
    		* Business Worth = A - L = Net Worth

* considerations: 
	1. Spreads are determined by liquidity, as well as supply and demand for a specific security.

### [Exercise Price]
* purchase security: call option
* sold security: put option
	[Strike Price]: keys to determin the option's market price, also known as fixed exercise price
		1. strike price
		2. time to expiration
		3. assets volitility
		4. interest rate
		stock price > Cost of the option + strike price (call option) -> In the money
		stock price < Cost of the option + strike price (call option ) -> Out of the monney
		Put Option is in the reverse way

		Investors buy calls if they think the stock is going up in the future or if they sold the stock short and want to hedge against a possible surge in price. 

		In-the-money options have triggered the exercise price and are valuable, and out-of-the money options expire without triggering the exercise price and are not valuable.
