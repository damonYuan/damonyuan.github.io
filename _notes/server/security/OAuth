OAuth

# OAuth2 senario: https://malalanayake.wordpress.com/tag/oauth-2-0-scenarios/

1. Authorization Code

In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attack. The exchange of an authorization code for a token happens on the server side. Normally the consumer has the public key registered on the service provider and has the client id and private secret save in its server.

eg: - FACEBOOK_ID=1821424564802638
    - FACEBOOK_SECRET=2339bdf25f236a42fc3a18280bf455e8

Website C mimic A to get some Facebook resource, but it does not know the FACEBOOK_ID and its corresponding FACEBOOK_SECRET, so event if Facebook return it the Authorization Code, it cannot successfully ahenticate it, which means it cannot use the code to exchange for access token. 

2. Implicit

For client apps which are implemented in a browser using a scripting language. e.g, javascript do not alow redirect out of its domain.

3. Resource owner credentials (just login)

Normally used inside a mobile because redirection is not possible with mobile apps.
