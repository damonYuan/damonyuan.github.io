React Native
=============

1. iOS should disable 
   `Dead Code Stripping`
   in target settings.

2. componentDidMount  is a function of React components that React will call exactly once, just after the component has been loaded.

3. The way React works is that setState actually triggers a re-render and then the render function will notice that this.state.movies is no longer null.

4. Always make sure to call done() at the end of the promise chain, or any errors thrown will get swallowed.
