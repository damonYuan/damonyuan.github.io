1. How to identify a strategy that suits you

* In reality, maximum long-term growth is achieved by finding a strategy with the maxi- mum Sharpe ratio (defined in the next section), provided that you have access to sufficiently high leverage.

2. A taste for plausible strategies and their pitfalls

* Information Ratio = (Average of Excess Returns) / (Standard Deviation of Excess Returns),

where
 
  Excess Returns = Portfolio Returns - Benchmark Returns

* The Sharpe ratio is actually a special case of the information ratio, suitable when we have a dollar-neutral strategy, so that the benchmark to use is always the risk-free rate.

* As a rule of thumb, any strategy that has a Sharpe ratio of less than 1 is not suitable as a stand-alone strategy. For a strategy that achieves profitability almost every month, its (annualized) Sharpe ratio is typically greater than 2. For a strategy that is profitable al- most every day, its Sharpe ratio is usually greater than 3.
