   - in the source code position it is positioned: either at the Program level or directly in the body of another function (FunctionBody);
   - is created on entering the context stage;
   - influences variable object;
   - and is declared in the following way:
   ```
   function exampleFunc() {
   ...
   }
   ```

2. function can be declared:
   - directly in the global context
   - or inside the body of another function

3. Function Expression:
   - in the source code can only be defined at the expression position;
   - can have an optional name;
   - itâ€™s definition has no effect on variable object;
   - and is created at the code execution stage.

4. assignment expression and optional name

5. encapsulating pattern:

```
(function () {
  
  // initializing scope
  
})();
