React
=======

1. React provides the dangerouslySetInnerHTML property to skip XSS protection and render anything directly.
2. Custom Factories????
3. Style names are camel cased in order to be consistent with DOM properties (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage)
4. A form component with a value or checked prop is called a controlled component. In a controlled component, the value rendered inside the element will always reflect the value of the prop
5. If you want to set up an initial value for an uncontrolled form component, use the defaultValue prop instead of value.
6. use non-destructive methods
methods that will return an array with the desired mutations instead of actually changing the original one. map, filter, and concat are just a few examples of non-destructive array methods.
There are also alternatives for generating new objects with mutations in JavaScript, like using Object.assign.
7. whatwg-fetch
enable all browsers support fetch function
8. babel-polyfill
enable all browsers support Object.assign function
array.prototype.find
array.prototype.findIndex
9. React Immutability Helper
var update = require('react-addons-update');
upadte function: eg: let newStudent = update(student, {grades:{$push: ['A']}})
10. Optimistic updating and rollback is not a trivial task and can unfold in many outcomes, but it’s easy to cover the basic rollback scenario right now because of a side effect of working with immutable structures: you can keep a reference to the old state and revert it back in case of problems.
11. &#9776; is the HTML Entity for the ☰ utf-8 symbol (aka "Hamburger Menu")
12. npm install --save react-addons-css-transition-group.
13. You must provide the key attribute for all children of ReactCSSTransitionGroup, even when only rendering a single item because this is how React will determine which children have entered, left, or stayed.
14. the React Drag’nDrop supports different back ends.
