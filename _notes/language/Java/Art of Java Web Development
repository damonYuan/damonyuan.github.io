# Part I evolution and design patterns

### Chapter 1. State-of-the-art web design

1. console applications -> event-driven applications -> stateless applications

2. evolution
   
   * servlets
   * JSPs (JavaServer Pages): JSPs are parsed only once, converted to a servlet, and then exec.

3. a pattern has the following characteristics:

   * the pattern name is a succinct, easy-to-remember moniker for the pattern
   * the problem is a statement describing the difficulty and its context
   * the solution describes the software artifacts that solve this problem
   * the consequences are the results and the trade-offs of applying the pattern

4. MVC

5. Model 2
   
   * In Model 2 for Java web applications, JavaBeans represent the model. Notice that this may include simple JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), or JavaBeans that act as proxies for EJBs.     
   * the view is rendered with JSP, which makes sense because JSP is closely tied to HTML
   * the controller is a servlet, well suited to executing Java code  

     - One of the key concepts in this design mandates that no real logic be per- formed by the JSP.
     - The model beans in this design should not be aware that they are being used in a web application.

 6. traditional without the use of design patterns or other refine techniques. -> JSP tags -> Model 2
