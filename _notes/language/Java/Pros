Pros

1. Function of infinite scroll is finished.
2. EndlessRecyclerViewScrollListener.java is generic and has taken three layouts into consideration.
3. Has taken local data source and remote data source into consideration.
4. MVP.
5. Will check the network connection.

Cons

1. No tests.
2. No pagination. It will lead to memory leak if loading many different images, now the array refer to the same image so that won't crash.
3. CityGuideFragment.java L116 use application context, not good but minor.
4. Once enter RemoteDataSource.java L45, cannot load data any more, and only kill the app make it revive.
