# What is an Architect

An architect’s role on a software project is to provide a working model of the problem that needs to be solved. The job of the architect is to provide the scaffolding against which developers will build their code so that all the pieces of the application fit together.

# Key Factors in Software Architecture

aspecs

## Availability / Reliability

Key Words: standard workflow with Automation, eg., Git Flow with CI / CD.

## Scalability

## Performance

## Extensibility

## Cost

## Security

# When building a Microservices Architecture

The architect’s job is to see the big picture and understand how an application can be decomposed into individual microservices and how the microservices will interact to deliver a solution.

A project’s architect focuses on three key tasks:

  1. Decomposing the business problem

     - Describe the business problem, and listen to the nouns you’re using to describe the problem.
     - Pay attention to the verbs.
     - Look for data cohesion. Microservices should completely own their data.

  2. Establishing service granularity

    - It’s better to start broad with your microservice and refactor to smaller services
    - Focus first on how your services will interact with one another
    - Service responsibilities will change over time as your understanding of the problem domain grows

  3. Defining the service interfaces

# When building a Mobile Application Architecture  

The architect’s job is to see the big picture and understand how an application can be decomposed into individual modules / components and how the applications under the same organization will interact to deliver a solution.
