1. Application Samples Demo -> Question
   No access to it. Have tried the account provided in the email.

2. Drivers 
   The same as the one downloaded from Ingenico website, used to set the configuration of ingenico device.
   Do we need to set it or it will be set by Global Payment before the Ingenico devices are distributed?

3. Important tib -> Questions
   3.1 ICO-OPE-02725-IN-EN_TIB_SDK 9.20.2_Use of iPP3xx in emulation mode_V2.pdf  
       We are targeting at iCMP so this pdf should be useless. Please confirm.

   3.2 SSLv3 communication.docx
       Consider the communication is handled by the SDK, should it be handled by the SDK rather than Bindo application?

   3.3 ICO-OPE-01683-IN-EN_TIB_SecurityAlert_HeartBleed.pdf
       It memtions about the TELIUM SDK. Does the POSgate iOS SDK falls into this scope?

   3.4 ICO-OPE-00983_TIB_WarningForUseOfLinkLayer.pdf
       Ok.

   3.5 ICO-PE-00788-IN-EN_TIB_WarningIngeDev.pdf
       This file is related to JAVA SDK only. Please confirm.

   3.6 ICO-OPE-0619-IN-EN_TIB_980_963_reboot.pdf
       This file targets at iPP480 and E532 and EFT93oS. Ignore because we are using iCMP. Please confirm.  

   3.7 ICO-PE-00132-IN-EN.pdf
       No downward issue for Bindo now. Ignore.   

   3.8 SDK8.2-ICO-PE-504-IN-EN-V1.pdf
       Issue about CAD30. Ignore.

   3.9 PCI v3  FAQ v1.7.pdf
       Does the PosGate SDK use online PIN or offline PIN.
       Where is the PKI used? The communication between Ingenico device with Global Payment gateway or Ingenico device with Bindo POS? 
       If it is used in the SDK, what version is it?

   3.10 ICO-PE-273-IN-EN-V2.pdf
        OK.

4. PosGate_SDK
   4.1 POSgate iOS SDK v1.21.zip
       There is a Dependencies folder inside. Not sure what it is for. (CompanionTestSample and InteractivePayment)

   4.2 PosGatePos.xcodeproj
       4.2.1 After Built and Ingenico iCMP is connected to ipad, click GetStatus, responseText is "PINpad Not Connected"

             (Tried on RBA SDK, it shows connected.)

       4.2.2 Deployment Target 7.0 -> crash

   4.3 In Companion Selection View controller I can find 20197434, but Still PINpad Not Connected.

   4.4 appdelegate: [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] removeObjectForKey:@"posgate_host_force_internal_comms"]; // now uses posgate_host_enabled

   What's the meaning of the comment.

   4.5 [ICISMPDevice setWantedDevice:companion]; : what is the meaning ?

   4.6 prese Capture in Capture page, crash because of EXC_BAD_ACCESS when sending msg [TerminalSSL Connect]. I think it is cause by the terminal not detected by the app.

   4.7 Where to find the Catid and Caid -> how to configure a merchant.

   4.8 

5. Telium_Tools
   Related to JAVA, ignore.

6. Add-on PCL
   Strange it would be .exe file: Add-on_PCL_for_iOS_2.10.02_setup.exe
   Is it included in PosGate SDK?

7. EP2DEV
   No access to it. 

8. ISO8583 Protocol
   No access to it.

Note: 

1. Configure merchant : catid and caid
2. Initialise
